Hi everyone!

Given the wild weather right now, lots of you have been concerned with getting to campus for class this evening. In theory the worst of the storm should be over by 6ish, but if you’re not already on campus, you’ll have to deal with commuting and parking and walking.

In the [“Attendance and Participation” section of the syllabus](/syllabus.qmd#attendance-and-participation) I mentioned that I will stream our Thursday classes via Webex. You can access the link for that through iCollege (there should be a Webex link in the navigation bar).

If you can’t come this evening because of the weather that’s totally fine! You can connect remotely.
